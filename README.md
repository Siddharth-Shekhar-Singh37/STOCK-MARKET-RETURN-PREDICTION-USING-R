# STOCK-MARKET-RETURN-PREDICTION-USING-R
Predicted and assessed stock market returns of major indices (S&P 500 and FTSE) using historical price data to examine predictability patterns to enhance the efficiency of investment strategies. Employed rigorous quantitative analysis that involved calculation of log returns of the two financial 
indices, preparation of data to forecast and multiple statistical methods to analyze time series data. Developed and evaluated 
the effectiveness of five distinct forecasting models: Simple forecasts(Mean, Na√Øve, drift methods for baseline predictions), 
Moving Averages, Simple Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA, Time Series Decomposition(Trend, Seasonality, Residuals). 
Assessed each model across three different time horizons, utilizing historical data to understand their capabilities and 
limitations. Performed Accuracy tests like RMSE, MAE, MAPE, AIC which were supported by visual representation of 
forecasted vs actual values, Histogram, ACF, PACF and Density plots of the residuals for comprehensive analysis. The key 
libraries used for data analysis and modelling were- tidyverse, tidyquant, tsfe, fpp2, gt, dplyr, ggfortify, vtable, quantmod, 
stats, kableExtra, tidyr, knitr, ggplot2, dplyr, data.table, forecast, PerformanceAnalytics, Metrics.
